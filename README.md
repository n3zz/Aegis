# Welcome to Project Aegis

Hey there, if you are familiar with the previous repo and are wondering what happened to it - simple thing is that I needed a reset. The project had way too many moving parts added uncesssarily which caused a paralysis in terms of what decisions to make for the code.

# What is Project Aegis

Project Aegis is a tool used for Security Architecture and Engineering Education. Mainly will be focusing on how to implement these sort of skills within Development Operations (DevOps) which in turn helps with a better understanding of DevSecOps. This allows people to understand the left shift priority in Security Architecturing and Engineering. For e.g. Threat Detection, Product Engineering, Security Automation.
Users of this tool can have a range of expertise from beginner to advanced.

# Development and Syllabus

> [!NOTE]  
> Syllabus and Roadmap MDs should be coming out soon - I have to reword them again and basically pull my finger out lol.

## Philosophy and Final Remarks
Only me right now - but the philosophy is simple...
_Always be curious. Always be willing to learn. There is no finish line for learning. But look at how far you have come_

This project is something that evolves with your feedback and in turn helps me and my understanding of programming and security in general :)
