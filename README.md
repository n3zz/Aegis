# Hello!

This is the beginning of Project Aegis!
Project Aegis is upcoming tool used for Blue-Team Security analysts/specialists who would specifically want to get into Threat Detection Engineering or Product Engineering.

Project Aegis - Author: Ary/D4WNW4LK3R (that's me!)

## What is Aegis used for?

Or who would like to know what specific tooling is used and have just started to understand that area. This is something particularly close to me and this is project that I am developing as I am learning.

Users who already have completed basic Cyber Security concepts as well as have a bit of experience within the field further research 
(Maybe we have a beginner module for people who are looking completely new later on down the line)

What will it teach (and what are it's initial features) ?

Main aim is to teach threat detection engineering
- Sigma Rules
- How does signature based and anomaly based detection work

I am gonna keep it a buck chief. I still suck at coding. However, this is a project that's aimed to change that and I want to make this a really cool tool for consumers and businesses to use alike.

I will come up with a roadmap for this don't worry. For now it's just a static page and a README!

## What's under the hood and what am I learning to implement this?

**Languages**: Go, JavaScript and eventually move it to TypeScript, Python
**Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform
**Cloud**: AWS, Azure - Most likely starting with AWS and then will hop to Azure! - Everything will start with the free tier and then eventually when this project becomes more fleshed out there will be a more pub-sub architecture. But prices will be reasonable and will provide people a platform to kickstart their career within Blue teaming.
**Security Tooling**: ELK Stack, Sigma, AWS. Trying to also learn something similar to what Monzo do for their Security pipeline which is within their [Response Github](https://github.com/monzo/response)

## Philosophy and Final Remarks

Only me right now - but the philosophy is simple...
_Always be curious. Always be willing to learn. Because with knowledge, you can put anything into practice._

This project is something that evolves with your feedback and directly affects me and my understanding of programming and security.

Hope you will join me on and stick along for this journey!
